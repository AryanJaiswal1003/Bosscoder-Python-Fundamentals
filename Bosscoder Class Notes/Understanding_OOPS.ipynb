    "# -------------------------------- UNDERSTANDING OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming) --------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is OOPS?\n",
    "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", \n",
    "# which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods/functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key OOPS Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. CLASS:\n",
    "#    - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
    "#    - It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
    "#    - Example:\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    # Attributes: name, age\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Attribute\n",
    "        self.age = age    # Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Method: bark\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. OBJECT:\n",
    "#    - An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "#    - It represents a specific entity with its own data.\n",
    "#    - Example:\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)  # dog1 is an object of class Dog\n",
    "dog1.bark()  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. ATTRIBUTES:\n",
    "#    - Attributes are variables that belong to a class or object.\n",
    "#    - They store information about the object.\n",
    "#    - Example: In the Dog class above, 'name' and 'age' are attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. METHOD:\n",
    "#    - Methods are functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object.\n",
    "#    - Example: 'bark' is a method of the Dog class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. ENCAPSULATION:\n",
    "#    - Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within one unit (class).\n",
    "#    - It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is called data hiding.\n",
    "#    - Example:\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "print(person1.get_name())  # Output: Alice\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. INHERITANCE:\n",
    "#    - Inheritance allows a class (child/derived) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/base).\n",
    "#    - Promotes code reuse.\n",
    "#    - Example:\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def meow(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "cat1 = Cat()\n",
    "cat1.speak()  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "cat1.meow()   # Output: Meow!\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. POLYMORPHISM:\n",
    "#    - Polymorphism means \"many forms\". It allows methods to do different things based on the object calling them.\n",
    "#    - Example:\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Some generic bird sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Sparrow(Bird):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Chirp Chirp\")\n",
    "\n",
    "bird1 = Bird()\n",
    "sparrow1 = Sparrow()\n",
    "bird1.sound()      # Output: Some generic bird sound\n",
    "sparrow1.sound()   # Output: Chirp Chirp\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. ABSTRACTION:\n",
    "#    - Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.\n",
    "#    - In Python, abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes (from abc module).\n",
    "#    - Example:\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Vehicle(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Car started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "car1 = Car()\n",
    "car1.start()  # Output: Car started\n",
    "\n",
    "# BENEFITS OF OOPS:\n",
    "# - Makes code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "# - Models real-world entities more naturally.\n",
    "# - Supports code organization and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SUMMARY:\n",
    "# OOPS is a powerful way to structure and organize code using classes and objects, making programs more flexible and easier to manage."
